My name is Jourdan, and I work in SRE and Security at Sophos.

I called this site Foggy Clouds because I thought it was catchy, and I think it captures my
journey learning cloud and DevOps technology. Coming from the traditional infrastructure world,
the process of learning DevOps and modern cloud practices felt nothing if not vague and foggy.

I hope to offer you some insights I've gained during this time. I update this site with articles
about things I'm working on, learning, and building. If you'd like to connect, find me on
the social links in the footer.
